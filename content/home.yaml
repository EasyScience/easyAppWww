  title: Build graphical _applications_ for data analysis and modelling _easily_
  description: >-
    Application skeleton with eye-catching and intuitive graphical interface for
    the [easyScience](https://easyscience.software) framework. Quickly build
    all-in-one cross-platform applications using the provided collection of
    Qt QML components, Python tools, and by binding with the
    [easyCore](https://app.easyscience.software) Python backend.
  description_extra: >-
    Current success stories are for the fields of powder neutron
    diffraction ([easyDiffraction](https://easydiffraction.org)) and
    reflectometry ([easyReflectometry](https://easyreflectometry.org)),
    where user defined models are used for simulations and can be refined
    against experimental data.
